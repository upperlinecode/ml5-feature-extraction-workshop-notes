Teacher Notes for Using Feature Extraction with ML5

Start off by talking about what machine learning is. How do we train them? In this workshop we'll be using a a pre-trained model called MobileNet that can classify objects. We're going to peel away the classification piece and instead build our own labels by adding our own training images to the model. 

Head to our starter code, (found here)[https://glitch.com/edit/#!/feature-extraction-starter-code].
